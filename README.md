# Chess
<b>I created the wonderful game of Chess!</b>

This program is currently a Work in Progress, and it is in the command line version still. Conditions such as a checkmate and stalemate are still underway.

Later, I will implement GUI for the pieces and a best move engine.

I learned a lot about OOP, ArrayList, Array, and Matrix Data Structures, and I plan on implementing linked lists or Hashmaps (not likely though since ArrayLists do the trick) to increase efficiency and speed.

The game features your typical chess moves with enPassant and castling.

Here are some images of an opening, with the white pawn capturing the black pawn:
