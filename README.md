# Chess
<b>I created the wonderful game of Chess!</b>

The program is built in Java. 

I learned a lot about OOP, ArrayList, Array, and Matrix Data Structures making this chess program. I plan on implementing linked lists or Hashmaps (not likely though since ArrayLists do the trick) to increase efficiency and speed.

The game features your typical chess moves with enPassant and castling.

Here are some images of an opening, with the white pawn capturing the black pawn:

This program is currently a Work in Progress, and it is in the command line version still. Stalemate is still on the way. Planning on making a graphics version with engines soon.

Later, I will implement GUI for the pieces and a best move engine.
